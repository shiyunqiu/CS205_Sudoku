This directory contains the solution to AM225 HW1 P4, with credit to Chris the instructor. Yiqi has made some modification to the file arangement and the makefile content, so that the compilation can pass and the tests can work on his MacOS X.

**NOTE**

To make sure that openMP (or flag `-fopenmp`) gets supported on MacOS X, you have to install the "true" g++ compiler instead of using the Xcode version. For the source code and makefile in this directory, homebrew is the preferred approach install g++. Check this [link](http://www.mathcancer.org/blog/setting-up-gcc-openmp-on-osx-homebrew-edition/) for detailed instructions.
